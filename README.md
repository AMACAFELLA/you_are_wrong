# you_are_wrong
 You're Wrong is a thread/twitter like app where instead of agreeing on points the aim is to disagree with the original post and whoever gets the most dislikes is awarded "You're the Worst  Medal". This is soley for entertainment purposes only and is not to be considered to take what users say on the app to be serious.
